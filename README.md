# tournament

## Project Summary
This project develops a database schema to store the game matches between players. I then write code to query this data and determine the winners of various games

## Installation
Make sure to download all of the files in this repository and save the files in the same local folder. After running `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh` in the vagrant's directory, navigate to the folder's directory and use `psql` and then `i\ tournament.sql` to import the sql file so that the database will be ready for the queries. Then, `\q` to go back to the directory, and run the test python file using `python tournament_test.py`.
